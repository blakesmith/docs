This section documents the API calls that the TempoIQ backend supports.

In the API libraries, these calls are exposed as methods on a ``Client`` object.
Clients may also expose convenience methods for special cases of some calls.

When using the HTTP interface directly, supply the documented method's argument
as a JSON body in the HTTP request.
